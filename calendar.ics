SUMMARY:Animal Farm Background and Context
DESCRIPTION: \n\n\n.... Author\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\n.... Year Published\n\n1945\n\n.... Type\n\nNovel\n\n.... Genre\n\nAllegory\, Satire\n\n.... Perspective and Narrator\n\n \n\n/Animal Farm/ has a third-person omniscient narrator.\n\n \n\n.... Tense\n\n \n\n/Animal Farm/ is written in the past tense.\n\n.... About the Title\n\n \n\n/Animal Farm/ takes its name from the book's setting\, Manor Farm\, which the  \nrebellious animals rename Animal Farm when they seize control.\n\n \n\n-------- THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AND ITS AFTERMATH ----------------------------\n\nRussian Revolution:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0TBJ381gSo Opening Video\n\nOn its surface\, /Animal Farm/ seems to be a simple tale about talking  \nanimals on a farm—a children's story\, some might think. But this surface is  \nthe allegory\, or story with a hidden political meaning\, of the Russian  \nRevolution of 1917\, the civil war that followed (1918–20)\, and the later  \nrise of Stalin's dictatorship in the Soviet Union. The novel draws clear  \nparallels between Josef Stalin and the pig Napoleon [1]. To serve his own  \nends\, Napoleon distorts Old Major [2]'s idealized dream of equality and  \nbrotherhood for all animals as he rules the farm. In the same way\, Stalin  \ndistorted the ideals of Marxist communism to feed his own desire for power  \nand control in the Soviet Union. While Marxist communism gave workers control  \nof production\, Stalin's version gave the state control of production\, paving  \nthe way for totalitarian rule. Stalin was an active participant in the  \nRevolution of 1917\, which overthrew Russia's Tsar Nicolas II. Stalin remained  \na high-ranking member of the government under Vladimir Lenin\, the first head  \nof the Soviet Union after the revolution. Then Stalin led the Communist Party  \nin the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death in 1953. In the same way in  \nwhich Napoleon finds himself in conflict with the intellectual Snowball [3]\,  \nStalin battled Leon Trotsky\, who had essentially served as Lenin's  \nsecond-in-command\, for the direction of the party and the Soviet Union after  \nLenin's death in 1924. After driving Trotsky into exile in 1929\, Stalin took  \nfull control of the party and the country.\n\nOnce Stalin took control of the Soviet Union\, he focused on eliminating any  \nperceived threats to his power\, culminating in the Great Purge of the late  \n1930s during which he had millions of people\, including his political  \nopponents\, imprisoned or killed. In 1939 he entered into an alliance with  \nHitler (which ended in 1941 when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union). In the  \nmeantime Stalin and his close supporters remained comfortable while the  \npeople of the Soviet Union suffered deprivation and hardship\, both during  \nwartime and after. The government used propaganda to inspire loyalty in the  \npopulace\, and as in the world of /Animal Farm/\, where propaganda failed\,  \nfear and intimidation succeeded.\n\nContext of the novella: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67bVJWqzYKE&t=4s\n\n-------- ADULT SATIRE --------------------------------------------------------\n\n/Animal Farm/ was Orwell [4]'s first novel to enjoy wide commercial  \nsuccess. However\, when it was first published booksellers placed it in the  \nchildren's section of their stores because they did not realize it was adult  \nsatire\, or a work that makes use of literary techniques\, such as humor\,  \nirony\, or hyperbole\, to criticize a figure\, event\, or issue. Orwell himself  \ntraveled from store to store convincing them to shelve it with adult books\,  \nwhere it remains categorized.\n\nThe novel continues to have contemporary relevance. While the specific  \ncontent of the novel addresses Soviet Russia\, it also serves as a broader  \ncautionary tale by showing how a corrupt and selfish leader who uses fear and  \nignorance to gain control can lead to a totalitarian government. In this way  \nthe novel warns against complacency in the populace. Orwell wrote the  \nfollowing response to a query from fellow political writer Dwight Macdonald:  \n"Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution. But  \nI did mean it to have a wider application in so much that I meant that /that  \nkind/ of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution\, led by unconsciously  \npower-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters. I meant the moral  \nto be that revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are  \nalert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done  \ntheir job." In this respect /Animal Farm/ continues to have relevance for  \ncitizens who live under all forms of government.\n\nTying the Revolution to Animal Farm\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOn6y61wcTI&t=1s \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n[1] https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Animal-Farm/character-analysis/#Napoleon\n[2] https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Animal-Farm/character-analysis/#Old_Major\n[3] https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Animal-Farm/character-analysis/#Snowball\n[4] https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Animal-Farm/author/ - Link: http://westmountcharter.schoology.com/event/7550272697/profile

SUMMARY:Animal Farm: Introduction of Characters
DESCRIPTION:Characters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6a5HYBFObY \n\n \n\nCharacter            Description\n\nNapoleon            Napoleon is the totalitarian pig leader of  \nAnimal Farm who exploits the other animals to maintain his own power. \n\nSnowball              Snowball is an early pig leader of Animal  \nFarm whose conflicts with Napoleon lead to his dishonor and exile. \n\nMr. Jones            Mr. Jones is the drunken\, neglectful  \nproprietor of Manor Farm\, overthrown by his animals. \n\nSquealer              Squealer is Napoleon's second pig in  \ncommand\, who spins stories and propaganda to keep the animals in line. \n\nBoxer    Boxer is the hardworking horse whose devotion to Animal Farm  \nearns him the respect of all the animals. \n\nOld Major            Old Major is the boar whose vision for a  \nworld where animals are free inspires the rebellion. \n\nBenjamin             Benjamin is a cynical donkey who is at least  \nas clever as the pigs but refuses to get involved with the rebellion\, even  \nwhen he sees things going wrong. \n\nBluebell                Jessie and Bluebell are Mr. Jones's  \ndogs who give birth to the puppies who grow up to be Napoleon's enforcers.\n\nClover   Clover is a working horse who is Boxer's companion and is as  \ndevoted to the cause of Animalism as he is.\n\nDogs      Dogs are the animals most closely aligned with the pigs\, who  \nserve as the pigs' guards and enforcers.\n\nHens      Hens are egg producers for the farm who\, at one point\, attempt  \na rebellion\, with disastrous results.\n\nJessie    Jessie and Bluebell are Mr. Jones's dogs who give birth to the  \npuppies who grow up to be Napoleon's enforcers.\n\nMollie   Mollie is Mr. Jones's mare who values her own appearance and the  \nfavor of humans over the principles of the farm.\n\nMoses  Moses is a trained raven who tells the animals stories of a heavenly  \nafterworld called Sugarcandy Mountain.\n\nMr. Frederick     Frederick is the owner of a neighboring farm who  \nbecomes Napoleon's enemy when he cheats the pigs and attacks the farm.\n\nMr. Pilkington    Pilkington is the owner of a neighboring farm who  \neventually becomes Napoleon's ally.\n\nMr. Whymper   Mr. Whymper is a lawyer retained by the pigs to conduct their  \nbusiness transactions with other humans.\n\nMuriel   Muriel is a goat who\, aside from Benjamin and the pigs\, is the  \nonly animal on the farm who is fully literate.\n\nSheep   Sheep are useful spreaders of propaganda that can be relied upon to  \nstop debates or potential protests with their chanting.\n\nMajor Characters ANALYSIS\n\n \n\n-------- NAPOLEON ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nNot a very strong public speaker\, the pig Napoleon rules the farm through  \nstrong-arm tactics and cunning. He makes the farm prosperous but keeps most  \nof the wealth for himself\, working the other animals with a level of  \nefficiency that borders on the brutal. He is ruthless toward his enemies\,  \nordering the executions of those who dare to cross him. Napoleon represents  \nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin.\n\n \n\n-------- SNOWBALL ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nSnowball is a pig on an equal footing with Napoleon after the rebellion\, and  \nhis intelligence and planning ability become assets to the farm. His use of  \nmilitary strategy wins the Battle of the Cowshed\, and he originates the plans  \nfor the windmill. His popularity and his ability threaten Napoleon's  \nambitions\, so Napoleon exiles him from the farm and makes him a scapegoat  \nwhen things go wrong. Thus his achievements are erased\, and history is  \nrewritten to vilify him. Snowball represents the banished Russian leader Leon  \nTrotsky.\n\n \n\n-------- MR. JONES -----------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nMr. Jones's neglect and mistreatment of his animals spark them to rebel  \nagainst him. After the animals take over the farm\, the threat of his return  \nis used to keep the animals from protesting and allows the pigs to get their  \nway. Mr. Jones represents Tsar Nicholas II.\n\n \n\n-------- SQUEALER ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nSquealer the pig acts as Napoleon's mouthpiece\, persuading the animals that  \nthe pigs are working in everyone's best interests. He presents information\,  \nsuch as false statistics\, that misleads the animals into believing what he  \nsays is true. He is a master of propaganda\, modeled after the Nazi  \npropagandist Joseph Goebbels\, and his energetic speaking style makes him an  \nappealing orator.\n\n \n\n-------- BOXER ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nBoxer the horse believes every problem can be solved with hard work and  \npersistence. His strength and work ethic make the building of the windmills  \npossible\, and he is a mighty asset in battle. All the animals look up to him  \nbecause his belief in Animalism is pure and his intentions are good. However\,  \nhis lack of intelligence and his naiveté cause him to follow the pigs  \nblindly\, and they "reward" his hard work by selling him to a slaughterer when  \nhis health fails. Boxer represents the proletariat\, or working-class people.\n\n \n\n-------- OLD MAJOR -----------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nThe old boar who originates the principles of Animalism and encourages the  \nrebellion\, Old Major\, is revered by the animals. He dies shortly after  \npresenting his vision to the animals\, so he does not live to see how his  \nfellow pigs corrupt his ideals over time. Old Major is often interpreted to  \nrepresent Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin.\n\n \n\n-------- BENJAMIN ------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nPossibly the most intelligent animal on the farm\, the donkey Benjamin is  \nprevented from becoming useful to the rebellion by his cynicism and belief  \nthat nothing ever really changes. He might have the capacity to educate the  \nanimals about the pigs' intentions\, but his silence allows the pigs to take  \nover unimpeded.\n\n  - Link: http://westmountcharter.schoology.com/event/7550317842/profile

SUMMARY:Animal Farm Discussion Questions on Chapters 1-2
DESCRIPTION:How does the description of the first appearance of Old Major in Chapter 1  \nof /Animal Farm/ reflect his importance to the farm\, the animals\, and the  \nrebellion?\n\nAs the large cart horses Boxer and Clover appear in the animals' first  \nmeeting in /Animal Farm/\, what actions do they take\, and what do their  \nactions reveal about them?\n\n \n\nWhat does Benjamin mean in /Animal Farm/ Chapter 1 when he says instead of  \na tail to keep flies away he "would sooner have had no tail and no flies"?\n\nWhat are the products of labor the animals are forced to give to the humans  \nlisted in /Animal Farm/ Chapter 1\, and how do these losses affect the  \nanimals?\n\n \n\nWhat sort of world is presented in "Beasts of England\," the anthem of  \nrebellion presented in /Animal Farm/\, Chapter 1\, and why is this song  \nimportant to the animals?\n\nChapter 2\n\n What are the differences that emerge between Snowball and Napoleon as they  \nare introduced in /Animal Farm/ Chapter 2?\n\nWhat aspects of Mollie and her resistance to Animalism in /Animal  \nFarm/ Chapter 2 reveal a weakness in Animalism (and by extension\, communism)  \nas a philosophy and way of life?\n\nWhat is potentially dangerous about Boxer's and Clover's total loyalty to the  \npigs\, as presented in /Animal Farm/ Chapter 2?\n\nWhat bits of evidence in /Animal Farm/ Chapter 2 illustrate how the pigs'  \nintentions after the rebellion may not be in the best interests of all the  \nanimals?\n\n\n  - Link: http://westmountcharter.schoology.com/event/7550351042/profile

SUMMARY:Watch animated movie of Animal Farm
DESCRIPTION:*Animal Farm | **10 Things You Didn't Know*\n\n \n\nGeorge Orwell's dystopian novel /Animal Farm/ was a thinly veiled satire of  \nthe failures of the Soviet Union. The novel features animals that represent  \nhistorical characters\, including Napoleon the pig\, who stands in for Joseph  \nStalin. However\, present-day readers can draw connections between the novel's  \ncharacters and events in almost any totalitarian state.\n\nThe novel was picked up by the Book-of-the-Month Club [1] soon after its  \npublication in 1945\, and sales topped one million by the 1950s. By the turn  \nof the 21st century the deceptively simple /Animal Farm/ still draws  \nopposition and incites debate.\n\n \n\n*1. A vicious 10-year-old inspired **/Animal Farm/**'s setting.*\n\nWhen George Orwell lived in a small rural village\, he saw a 10-year-old boy  \n[2] whipping a large cart horse\, trying to get it to keep to a narrow path.  \nHe claimed he realized that "men exploit animals in much the same way as the  \nrich exploit the proletariat." Thus the idea for a tale about the failings of  \nthe Soviet state using animal characters was born.\n\n*2. The Spanish Civil War helped shape the events in **/Animal Farm/**.*\n\nGeorge Orwell fought against the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War [3] of  \nthe 1930s. He was wounded in the conflict\, and after recovering he was chased  \nfrom the country by Stalinists\, for whom he was not left-leaning enough.  \nOrwell was convinced by this experience that the Soviet Union was not an  \nup-and-coming utopia—but rather a dark and destructive threat. He  \nwrote /Animal Farm/ because he felt "the destruction of the Soviet myth was  \nessential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement."\n\n*3. Many publishers refused to publish **/Animal Farm/** for political  \nreasons.*\n\nOrwell began trying to publish [4] /Animal Farm/ in 1943\, when the Soviet  \nUnion was allied with the United States and the United Kingdom in World War  \nII. The book's allegorical criticism of the Soviet Union was politically  \nunpopular at the time\, and five reputable publishers refused the novel\,  \nciting in particular its use of pigs to represent the communists. A small  \npress led by Frederick Warburg finally took on the novel\, as well as Orwell's  \nnext novel\, the best-selling /1984/.\n\n*4. A Soviet spy tried to stop publication of **/Animal Farm/**.*\n\nThe publisher Jonathan Cape [5] accepted /Animal Farm/ for publication in  \n1944. However\, he was convinced not to publish the book by Peter Smollett\,  \nwho was the head of the Russian section of the British government's Ministry  \nof Information. Smollett was later unmasked as a Soviet spy.\n\n*5. Orwell actually had a pet goat named Muriel.*\n\nThe author and his first wife had several farm animals on their property in  \nWallington\, England—most notably a goat named Muriel. Photographs [6] of  \nOrwell taken around 1936 show the author feeding his pet goat near their  \ncottage. The writer's four-legged friend obviously made quite the impression\,  \ncoming to life again in Orwell's 1945 book as the wise\, old goat in /Animal  \nFarm/.\n\n*6. Pink Floyd used **/Animal Farm/** as inspiration for one of their  \nalbums.*\n\nOrwell has inspired thousands of creative minds\, including those of English  \nrock band Pink Floyd. Instead of critiquing Joseph Stalin and communism\,  \nhowever\, Floyd's 1977 album /Animals/ is a stinging commentary of  \ncapitalist ideals of the late-20th century. Not exactly the kind of stuff  \nyou'd dance to—in fact\, one music critic called it the band's "bleakest  \nstudio album [7]."\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n*7. An underground translation of **/Animal Farm/** was made for Soviet  \nrefugees.*\n\nIn 1946 a Soviet refugee read Orwell's /Animal Farm/ aloud in Ukrainian to  \na captivated audience of refugees in West Germany. When the refugee asked  \nOrwell to publish a Ukrainian translation of the novel\, Orwell not only  \nobliged—he refused any royalties made from the book\, AND he wrote the  \nrefugees a letter commending them for standing up to the totalitarian regime.  \nThe letter would become the only published introduction for /Animal Farm/.\n\n*8. Poet T.S. Eliot rejected Orwell's views in **/Animal Farm/**.*\n\nIt has to hurt when one of the biggest poets of the 20th century rejects your  \nwork\, but that didn't stop Orwell. In 1944 Orwell submitted /Animal  \nFarm/ to London publishing house Faber and Faber\, where poet T.S. Eliot was  \ndirector. Eliot let down Orwell easy enough though—he said /Animal  \nFarm/ was "a distinguished piece of writing" but rejected it [8] on the  \nbasis that it was unwise to "criticize the political situation at the present  \ntime."\n\n*9. Orwell's first word as a child was "beastly."*\n\nIt seems Orwell had a flair for drama even as a tot. According to  \nbiographers\, an 18-month-old Orwell—who had been laid up in bed with  \nbronchitis—rolled over and spoke his first word: "Beastly!" Orwell's mother  \nnoted in her 1905 diary entry [9] that Baby Eric had a penchant for calling  \neverything beastly\, and the adjective commonly appeared in his  \nwriting—ironically\, though\, not in /Animal Farm/.\n\n*10. The animated film adaptation of **/Animal Farm/** was funded by the  \nCIA.*\n\nIn 1954 the British film company Halas and Batchelor released an animated  \nversion [10] of /Animal Farm./ The film rights to the novel were acquired  \nby E. Howard Hunt\, later of Watergate scandal fame\, who eventually revealed  \nthat he had been a member of the CIA Psychological Warfare Workshop and had  \nbought the rights at the CIA's direction. The film was well-received\,  \nalthough the ending was changed so that the animals got outside help to crush  \ntheir pig ruler\, an ending approved by the CIA.\n\n\n[1] https://books.google.com/books?id=TG-YpkczTjEC&amp\;pg=PA163&amp\;lpg=PA163&amp\;dq=orwell+animal+farm+sales&amp\;source=bl&amp\;ots=jkq_iT3qy1&amp\;sig=57trcRB7HD7XODLpowoZZPOpIgc&amp\;hl=en&amp\;sa=X&amp\;ved=0ahUKEwirvPeZt6rMAhXIbD4KHVG8ALs4ChDoAQhCMAY#v=onepage&amp\;q=orwell%20animal%20farm%20sales&amp\;f=false\n[2] https://books.google.com/books?id=CnyY6gzf0CYC&amp\;pg=PA27&amp\;lpg=PA27&amp\;dq=ten+year+old+who+inspired+animal+farm+orwell&amp\;source=bl&amp\;ots=n12U97Xy4O&amp\;sig=bdDHw8OFHuIEGy_x_QTlhJ0jphM&amp\;hl=en&amp\;sa=X&amp\;ved=0ahUKEwiO9r2Nz6LMAhVBNz4KHRRPCW0Q6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp\;q=ten%20year%20old%20who%20inspired%20animal%20farm%20orwell&amp\;f=false\n[3] https://aussgworldpolitics.wordpress.com/opinions/animal-farm-reviewed-by-christopher-hitchens/\n[4] https://books.google.com/books?id=5wkquqRsevIC&amp\;pg=PA77&amp\;lpg=PA77&amp\;dq=soviet+spy+and+animal+farm&amp\;source=bl&amp\;ots=ivzb1vcKw-&amp\;sig=C9Foq-KiGM9xYvPFMBKkP4wP4yI&amp\;hl=en&amp\;sa=X&amp\;ved=0ahUKEwjS2Prk06LMAhXJzz4KHTBZD20Q6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp\;q=soviet%20spy%20and%20animal%20farm&amp\;f=false\n[5] https://books.google.com/books?id=SDSGCgAAQBAJ&amp\;pg=PT94&amp\;lpg=PT94&amp\;dq=soviet+spy+and+animal+farm&amp\;source=bl&amp\;ots=oZSyC3eRzy&amp\;sig=xbREmR4Lq8T_RJwcRjbozl2oBRI&amp\;hl=en&amp\;sa=X&amp\;ved=0ahUKEwjF39_fgqPMAhXDwj4KHd33Bmw4ChDoAQg9MAU#v=onepage&amp\;q=soviet%20spy%20and%20animal%20farm&amp\;f=false\n[6] https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/photograph-of-orwell-feeding-muriel-the-goat-by-collings\n[7] http://www.openculture.com/2017/04/pink-floyd-adapts-orwells-animal-farm-into-its-1977-concept-album-animals.html\n[8] https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/letter-from-t-s-eliot-faber-to-george-orwell-rejecting-animal-farm-13-july-1944\n[9] https://books.google.com/books?id=Ya5R7XFg3c4C&amp\;pg=PA19&amp\;lpg=PA19&amp\;dq=george+orwell%27s+mother+diary+beastly&amp\;source=bl&amp\;ots=_MH77IpUFx&amp\;sig=E6eBdH_EDnzW-wKTltAltrpnl_g&amp\;hl=en&amp\;sa=X&amp\;ved=0ahUKEwiS09ST-ePUAhVDllQKHXMqBj0Q6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp\;q=george%20orwell&#039\;s%20mother%20diary%20beastly&amp\;f=false\n[10] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/ - Link: http://westmountcharter.schoology.com/event/7498878522/profile
